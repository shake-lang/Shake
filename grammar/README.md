# Shake Grammar

This folder contains multiple formats of the shake grammar for the shake language. **Note: FOr the best performace, the shake parser is written from scratch and is not generated from a grammar file.**
For some cases, it might be usefull to have grammar files, for example for syntax highlighting in editors.

These files are strictly following the shake language specification and should mirror the exact behavior of the shake compiler implementation.
