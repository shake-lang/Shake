# Shakespeare

Shakespeare is a tool for generating shake code programmatically using a simple api.
It was originally written to generate the code for shake's unit tests, so the compiler
is always tested against shakespeare. For this reason, it also includes a module for
generating a shake AST from the created code (used to test shake's parser).
