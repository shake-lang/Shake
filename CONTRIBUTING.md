# Contributing

## Introduction

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Shake. We're open source and powerd by Contributors.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this
open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests.

Please also be familliar with our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/shakelang/shake/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or writing tutorials are all examples of helpful contributions
that mean less work for you.

## Ground Rules

This includes not just how to communicate with others (being respectful, considerate, etc) but also technical
responsibilities (importance of testing, project dependencies, etc).

Responsibilities

* Ensure cross-platform compatibility for every change that's accepted. Windows, Mac, Debian & Ubuntu Linux.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get
  community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See
  the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/shakelang/shake/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Shake? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for
impact a given change will have.

### Never contributed to a project before?

Shake isn't a particularly easy project to start with. But if you are able to work with the codebase, you are very
welcome to try.

Here are a few helpful resources:

- [http://makeapullrequest.com/](http://makeapullrequest.com/)
- [http://www.firsttimersonly.com/](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/)

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free*
series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update
your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started

### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.

How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

All tests can be run using gradle, they should be run **before** you create a pull request. (`gradle build`).

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * With submitting your pull request, you are okay with us merging and using your code. **Be sure to only contribute
      code you are allowed to use**
    * Explain your changes and why they are needed in your pull request

## How to report a bug

- If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue.
  Email [security@shakelang.com](mailto:security@shakelang.com)
- In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
    * Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
    * Can I disable something for other people?

If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that
even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just
email us at security@travis-ci.org.

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of java are you using (go version)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

You are welcome to suggest features using the github issue-tracker!

## Code review process

The code will be reviewed by our team members and if we find it to be good, we will push it to a development branch and
enroll it with an upcoming release.

## Community

Discussions and help with contributions can be found on our [discord](https://discord.shakelang.com/).

## Becoming a team member

If you have contributed multiple times and want to get deeper into the project, you may wan't to join the shakelang
team. In addition to having much fun improving shake,
you will get a fancy `@shakelang.com` email address.

Please only ask if you really mean to contribute and have done so multiple times. There is an amount of responsability
and we will discuiss new people with the whole team.
